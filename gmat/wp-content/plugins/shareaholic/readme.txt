We have share buttons for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google+, and many more within a single social dashboard. We also offer monetization tools for affiliate links, outstream video ads, native ads, and related posts.
2. Easily add related content and related post sections to your site to drive increased page views and time on site. 
3. Add and customize your share buttons to maximize you social sharing on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google+, and many more.
4. Because most everyone in our demographic uses ad-blocker, Related Content is a great way to suggest other products they may like because it’s relevant to the post they are reading.
5. I love that Related Content is already included in the Shareaholic WordPress plugin because it keeps my blog uncluttered and my page load time to a minimum.
6. Since installing Related Content, I’ve loved seeing more traffic on my older posts.
7. Because I produce a ton of content every day, I rely on Related Content to pull posts for my readers that they wouldn’t find on their own.

= Shareaholic Shortcode Support / Manual Usage =

You can place Share Buttons, Related Content and any other Shareaholic apps manually wherever you're like in your theme. Simply insert the following Shortcode where you want the corresponding app to appear:

`[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="recommendations" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="ad_spaces" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="follow_buttons" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]`
`[shareaholic app="total_share_count"]`

Grab the corresponding App ID from your Shareaholic Dashboard for the App you want to manually insert into your theme. If you prefer, you can also use the `App Name` instead of the `App ID`. This can be very useful for multi-site installations and theme developers who would like to bundle Shareaholic. For example:

`[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id_name="post_below_content"]`

If both `id` and `id_name` are defined, `id` will take priority.

In your PHP / theme template code, you would add:

`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="recommendations" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here>"]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="ad_spaces" id="<Insert Shareaholic App ID here"]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app="follow_buttons" id="Insert Shareaholic App ID here"]'); ?>`

Note: optionally, you can specify `title`, `link` or `summary` as Shareaholic shortcode parameters. If you don't specify these optional parameters, the shortcode will automatically determine these values.

Example:

`[shareaholic app="share_buttons" id="<insert shareaholic app ID here>" title="About Me" link="http://mysite.com/about" summary="This is me"]`

If use double quotes ("'s) in your title or summary, make sure to encode them properly as `&quot;`. Shareaholic Shortcode's are full featured and support all available configuration options available. Enjoy!
